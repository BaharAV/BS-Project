Presentation and Summary files for my BSc Project: Implementation of a System for Describing Images with AI models on Mobile Phones.

Android application connected to a sever to use AI models for object recognition and detection, image captioning and music genre suggestion based on objects.

Back-end and Server: Implemented by Python and Flask under a microservice architecture and deployed by Docker.

Front-end: Implemented as an Android application using Android Studio and Java.
