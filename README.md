Presentation and Summary files for my BSc thesis project: Design and implementation of a system for describing images with artificial intelligence models on mobile phones

Android application connected to a sever to use AI models for object recognition and detection, image captioning and music genre suggestion based on objects.

Back-end and Server: Implemented by Python and Flask under a microservice architecture and deployed by Docker.

Front-end: Implemented as an Android application using Android Studio and Java.

AI: Used saved object detection models from Tensorflow, Saved Image Captioning models based on the Show, Attend, and Tell method, and additional NLP methods to define word associations.
