Presentation and Summary files for my BS thesis project: Design and Implementation of an AI-powered Image Description System for Mobile Devices.

An Android application integrated with a server to utilize AI models for object recognition and detection, image captioning, and suggesting music genres based on identified objects:

Back-end and server: Implemented using Python and Flask within a microservice architecture, and deployed using Docker.
Front-end: Developed as an Android application using Android Studio and Java.
AI: Utilized pre-trained object detection models from TensorFlow, image captioning models based on the Show, Attend, and Tell method, and additional NLP techniques for word association.
